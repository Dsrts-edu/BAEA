Basic A** Election Analaysis : Uses results from NYT to esitmate wins and losses of close races using standing county results ratios as a hueristic


<h1> Notes for Use </h1>
<ul>
<li>
This uses results copied from the NYT ballot measures results page to estimate potential winners and losers of local (and often unforecasted) elections. 
</li> <li>
Counties that contain spaces will need to be manually formatted (for now) to include underscores. This is usually easy to do. A tool may be made for this. 
This is a current outstanding issue. 
</li>
</ul>

This project was mostly made for quick result guessing on election day and is far from complete. 

Project is open to use, but in-line credit is obviously appreciated.
