Basic A** Election Analaysis : Uses results from NYT to esitmate wins and losses of close races using standing county results ratios as a hueristic

This uses results copied from the NYT ballot measures results page to estimate potential winners and losers of local (and often unforecasted) elections. 

Counties that contain spaces will need to be manually formatted (for now) to include underscores. This is usually easy to do. A tool may be made for this. 
This is a current outstanding issue. 

This project was mostly made for quick result guessing on election day and is far from complete. 

Project is open to use, but in-line credit is obviously appreciated.
