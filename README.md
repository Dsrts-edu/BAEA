Basic A** Election Analaysis : Uses results from NYT to esitmate wins and losses of close races using standing county results ratios as a hueristic\
\
This uses results copied from the NYT ballot measures results page to estimate potential winners and losers of local (and often unforecasted) elections. \
\
Counties that contain spaces will need to be manually formatted (for now) to include underscores. This is usually easy to do. A tool may be made for this. \
This is a current outstanding issue. \
\
This project was mostly made for quick result guessing on election day and is far from complete. \
\
Project is open to use, but in-line credit is obviously appreciated. \
